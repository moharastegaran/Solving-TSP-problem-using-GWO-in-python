# Solving TSP problem using GWO in python

This python based code represents an algorithm based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is called (GWO-TSP).




## Run Locally

Clone the repo

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/moharastegaran/Solving-TSP-problem-using-GWO-in-python.git
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd Solving-TSP-problem-using-GWO-in-python
```

Once you cloned the repo, you'll have to need to install missing libraries using pip
```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
```
And you're good to go. Run GWO_TSP.py to plot graph as result of solving problem.
